This Python script offers a fun interactive experience of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. Utilizing the Tkinter library for graphical user interface elements, it allows players to engage in a strategic battle against an AI opponent.

The game follows traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules, where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' for the player and 'O' for the AI). The objective is to be the first to create a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while also preventing your opponent from doing the same.

The AI opponent employs the minimax algorithm to determine its moves, ensuring a challenging and dynamic gameplay experience. Upon completion of the game, whether by a player achieving victory or the game ending in a draw, a message box appears to announce the result.

With a clean and intuitive interface, this script provides an enjoyable way to test your skills against a cunning virtual opponent or challenge a friend to a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
